          My journey
        </p>

        <p className="text-xl mt-20">
          My fascination with software development ignited during my college
          years when I undertook a project that involved automating a complex
          data analysis process. Struggling with the intricacies of the task, I
          stumbled upon the world of coding as a potential solution. As I delved
          deeper into writing lines of code and witnessing the immediate impact
          it had on data manipulation, a newfound passion was born.
